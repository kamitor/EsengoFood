-   **cash-to-Cash Cycle Time (C2C)**:
    
    -   Measures the time it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flow from sales.
    -   Formula: $$C2C=DIO+DSO−DPOC2C=DIO+DSO−DPO$$
        -   DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding): Average number of days it takes to sell inventory.
        -   DSO (Days Sales Outstanding): Average number of days it takes to collect payment from customers.
        -   DPO (Days Payables Outstanding): Average number of days it takes to pay suppliers.
-   **Working Capital Ratio**:
    
    -   Measures a company's operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
    -   Formula: 
    $$
    Working\,Capital\,Ratio = \frac{Current\,Assets}{Current\,Liabilities}
  $$
-   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)**:
    
    -   A variation of the C2C that includes the time it takes to pay suppliers and considers the entire cash flow cycle.
    -   Formula: CCC=DIO+DSO−DPOCCC=DIO+DSO−DPO

-   **Inventory Turnover**:
    $$Inventory\,Turnover = \frac{Cost\,of\,Goods\,Sold}{Average\,Inventory}$$
    $$Inventory turnover ratio = cost of goods sold in period / [(opening stock in period-closing stock in period) / 2]##
    -   Measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory.
    -   Formula: Inventory Turnover=Cost of Goods SoldAverage 
-   **Accounts Receivable Turnover**:
    $$Accounts\,Receivable\,Turnover = \frac{Net\,Sales}{Average\,Accounts\,Receivable}$$
    -   Measures how quickly a company collects payments from customers.
    -   Formula: Accounts Receivable Turnover=Net SalesAverage Accounts ReceivableAccountsReceivableTurnover=AverageAccountsReceivableNetSales​

-   **Accounts Payable Turnover**:
    
    -   Measures how quickly a company pays its suppliers.
    -   Formula: Accounts Payable Turnover=Cost of Goods SoldAverage Accounts PayableAccountsPayableTurnover=AverageAccountsPayableCostofGoodsSold​

**Sustainability Formulas:**

1.  **Carbon Emissions Intensity**:
    
    -   _Formula_: `$$\text{Carbon Emissions Intensity} = \frac{\text{Total Carbon Emissions}}{\text{Production Output}}$$`
    -   _Description_: This formula calculates the carbon emissions intensity, which is the amount of carbon emissions produced per unit of production output. Lowering this intensity indicates a reduction in carbon emissions, showcasing Esengo's commitment to environmental sustainability.
2.  **Energy Efficiency Ratio**:
    
    -   _Formula_: `$$\text{Energy Efficiency Ratio} = \frac{\text{Energy Consumed}}{\text{Production Output}}$$`
    -   _Description_: The energy efficiency ratio assesses how efficiently energy is used in the production process. It calculates the amount of energy consumed per unit of production output. Esengo can improve sustainability by striving for a lower energy efficiency ratio, indicating reduced energy consumption for the same output.
3.  **Water Usage Efficiency**:
    
    -   _Formula_: `$$\text{Water Usage Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Water Consumed}}{\text{Production Output}}$$`
    -   _Description_: This formula gauges the efficiency of water usage in the supply chain by calculating the amount of water consumed per unit of production output. Lower water usage per unit of output demonstrates more sustainable water management practices, reflecting positively on Esengo's environmental stewardship.

**Productivity Formulas:**

1.  **Labor Productivity**:
    
    -   _Formula_: `$$\text{Labor Productivity} = \frac{\text{Output Produced}}{\text{Labor Hours}}$$`
    -   _Description_: Labor productivity measures the efficiency of the workforce in generating output. It computes the amount of output produced per labor hour. Esengo's success in improving labor productivity indicates efficient use of human resources, potentially leading to cost savings and increased output.
2.  **Asset Turnover**:
    
    -   _Formula_: `$$\text{Asset Turnover} = \frac{\text{Revenue Generated}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$`
    -   _Description_: Asset turnover assesses how efficiently a company utilizes its assets in generating revenue. It quantifies the revenue generated per unit of total assets. Esengo can aim for a higher asset turnover, indicating effective asset management and resource utilization.
3.  **Operational Efficiency**:
    
    -   _Formula_: `$$\text{Operational Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Output Achieved}}{\text{Input Used}}$$`
    -   _Description_: This formula measures operational efficiency by calculating the ratio of output achieved to the input used. It reflects how efficiently resources are utilized in the production process, contributing to overall productivity.
